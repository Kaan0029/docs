# OceanPulse: Connecting Illegal Fishing Detection with Marine Ecosystem Impact

## üåä Hackathon Overview (36-Hour Implementation)

OceanPulse is a sustainable technology solution that detects illegal fishing activities and correlates them with fish migration patterns to provide a comprehensive understanding of marine ecosystem impacts. This project builds upon concepts like ShipSense but adds a critical ecological dimension.

## ‚ùó The Problem

Illegal fishing threatens global marine ecosystems, with approximately 20% of all fish caught illegally. Traditional monitoring fails to connect vessel detection with ecological impact, creating an incomplete picture for conservation efforts.

## üí° Core Solution (36-Hour Implementation)

We will develop:

1. **Ship Detection Module**  
   A neural network that identifies fishing vessels in satellite imagery and analyzes suspicious "dark vessel" behavior

2. **Fish Migration Correlation**  
   An analysis engine that connects detected fishing activities to known fish migration routes and population data

3. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   A visualization platform that displays both vessel activities and ecological impacts in an integrated map interface
